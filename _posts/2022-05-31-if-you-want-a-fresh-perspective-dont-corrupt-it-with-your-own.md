title: "If you want a fresh perspective, don't corrupt it with your own."

You write an essay. Upon reviewing your work, you feel uncertain about the quality of your prose in paragraphs 2 and 4 and also whether the examples you listed in paragraph 7 are strong enough. You ask your friend for feedback:

YOU: Hey Bob, could you take a look at my essay? I think the main issues right now are my writing style in paragraphs 2 and 4, and I’m not sure if I listed sufficiently strong evidence in paragraph 7.

BOB: I agree with you about paragraphs 2 and 4; they don’t flow well. And yeah, list better examples. Overall, your essay’s pretty good! I also suggest you go through and cut out filler words or sentences. Your essay could be much more succinct.

You messed up. The entire *point* of asking people for feedback is to get a new perspective. You corrupted Bob by infecting him with your mindstate, locking him into the same Einstellung you were probably stuck in. Sure, you got a bit of new insight. But I’d bet heavily that Bob would’ve said something very different, likely much more valuable if you had just asked him to look at your essay without mentioning your own opinions.
