title: "Your Past Self Was A Real Person Too"

I've noticed it's pretty common for people to aggressively trash talk their past selves, saying things like "I was such an idiot back then!" They're leaving out the part they're really trying to communicate: "... 


I'm dumping the rest of what this blogpost is going to be here and will come back and restructure it
concept: caricaturing past self to self-signal? signal to others? not sure if self-signalling can even exist by definition

A journal entry from 05/04/2019:
“I’ve been haphazardly traipsing through life without any discipline whatsoever. From now on, I’ll approach each long-term goal in a surgical manner that ensures success.”
I also see that I apparently titled this journal “Reformation”...

This is an egregious example across all my journals. I have a tendency of caricaturing my past self, and this is useless. I think this tendency arises from needing to signal that my past self is so far removed from who I am right now because it’d be unbearable to think that I’m the same person.

Another from 02/23/2020:
	“Reading through each entry since 12/2—when I started journaling—shows that I’m really no better than before.”

There’s also a personal narrative essay that I’ve written multiple variants of where I talk about being overweight in middle school, eating “globs of Nutella” and playing Clash of Clans or whatever and just being really stupid.

Across my journals, there’s a recurring theme of me writing some strange exhortation to myself or my future self where I’m being more “poetic” than anything else and it’s pretty useless.

I wonder if I actually get any value from journaling.

I’ve noticed that it’s very easy to feel like you’re making progress especially when you caricature your past self because then you just say they were retarded and you aren’t so now you’re doing great but this is impossible to be sure of unless u have numbers.
